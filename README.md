YAWM.js
=======
Yet another Window Manager (in JavaScript, *Yay!*)

Huh, what is this?
------------------
Well, this is a new-years eve-experiment to see if one can make a simple WM in JavaScript. And I succeded to do that in just 42 lines of code.

It does not do much; it randomly places new windows. It can raise them for you, and move them in 7px-steps.

How to use
----------
Git the files to some local folder, direct your terminal at that folder and type `npm i` to install and then type `node yawm.js` to start it. This procedure assumes that you've got *npm* and *node.js* correctly installed. You might want to try to test this using *Xephyr* (recursive X-server).

<kbd>Super + U</kbd> Raises the window  
<kbd>Super + [Arrow Keys]</kbd> Moves the last raised window

To be continued in 2014 ;)
